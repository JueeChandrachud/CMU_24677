# CMU_24677
24677 Modern Control Theory - Modern Control for Robotics (Fall 24)

This repository stores my project done for the course. There are a total of 5 parts of this project, out of which the first 4 (P1-4) deal with controlling an unmanned ground vehicle, whereas the fifth (P5) is based on handling the thrust loss in a motor of an unmanned aerial vehicle.

Programming language: Python
Simulation Software: Webots

Summary of Projects:
P1: PID Control: Designed a PID longitudinal and lateral controller for the vehicle.
P2: Pole Placement: Designed a state feedback lateral controller using the Pole Placement method.
P3: LQR-A* Path Planning Algorithm: Implemented Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) to control the Tesla Model, and designed an A-star path planning algorithm to perform the obstacle avoidance/overtaking.
P4: EKF SLAM: Design an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) to estimate the global state of the vehicle.
P5: Adaptive Control: Implemented adaptive control theory to augment an LQR-based Model Predictive controller and test its effectiveness in the event of a single quadrotor motor experiencing a 50% loss of thrust during hovering.
